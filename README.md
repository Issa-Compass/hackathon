# Issa Compass — Vibe Hackathon 🧭

Welcome to the Vibe Hackathon by **Issa Compass** — a software company on a mission to make moving and living in a new country as easy as ordering from Grab. We’re starting with visas. More about us: [issacompass.com/about](https://www.issacompass.com/about)

## 🌟 Today's Project

Design an **AI assistant** that can respond to customer messages — helping them early through the visa process (before they get supported by our legal team), identifying high-intent customers, and don't sound like a robot.

You'll be working under [Aaron Yip](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-builds) 👋  
- 15+ years in Silicon Valley tech (self-driving cars, industry advisor for Apple, Google App of the Year)
- Startup builder, product guy, Stanford University + Chula guest lecturer

We’re offering **1 intern position** based on: **Main Character Energy** 🔥

## What We Look For

We care about **who you are**, not your resume.

### ✅ You Are:
- **Brave** — You push beyond comfort zones
- **Kind** — You help others and uplift your team
- **Competitive** — You want to win, and you work hard for it
- **Dream-Driven** — You have a big, bold vision for your future

### ❌ We Don’t Care:
- Which university you went to
- What tools or programming language you use (but we recommend Claude)
- Whether you work solo or with others
- Whether you call your professor or phone a friend

## 🛠️ Hackathon Prompt

**Build an AI Assistant for Customer Support**

### Input:
We’ve included a file with sample data: `conversations.py`  
This contains sample messages with customers

### Use it to:
- Understand common visa questions and issues
- Identify signals of high-interest customers
- Spot patterns in drop-offs or ghosting
- Anything else that will help build a useful assistant

### Requirements:
- Create a server or script that takes in a message (or series of messages) and responds intelligently by API call with LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc)
- But responses **must not sound like an AI** — make it human, casual, identical to the sample chat data
- Only respond when relevant (not to every single message)
- Identify when a customer is very interested and notify the team

#### ✅ Correct Behavior (Good assistant):
```Customer: Hello
Customer: How are you?
Customer: Can you tell me about work visas?
Customer: Thank you
Assistant: helpful humanlike response here similar to the data
```

#### ❌ Wrong Behavior:
```
Customer: Hello
Customer: How are you?
Customer: Can you tell me about work visas?
Customer: Thank you
Assistant: Hi there!
Assistant: I’m great, how are you?
Assistant: Sure!
Assistant: You’re welcome!
```

## 🧪 How to Submit
1. Work from anywhere - there's wifi here and the team usually gets lunch in the soi 
2. When you're done:
   - Send your GitHub project link to **aaron@issacompass.com**, cc **mai@issacompass.com**
   - Find Aaron in person before **6 PM** to do a **5-minute live demo** of your project

## 🎨 Be Creative, Be Memorable
Main characters stand out — not because they take the easy path, but because they rise to the moment. If you find the simplest answer, submit it, and head out - pause and ask yourself: Is that really Main Character Energy? 

This isn't about the most technical deep solution - but the most thoughtful one. Think of the main characters you admire — what would they do in this situation? They’d go deeper. Take risks. Push boundaries. That’s who we’re looking for.

Good luck and have fun!
